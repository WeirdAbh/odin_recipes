# odin_recipes
I made this repository as an assignment given to me by the "The Odin project".
If you don't know what The Odin Project is, follow this link below and you may understand.

This project is a basic recipe website. It will show some recipes on the website. That's just about it.

It is a practice website to polish my HTML skills.
