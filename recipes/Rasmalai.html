		<h2>How To Make Rasmalai</h2>

		 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
		 <ul>
			<li>12 to 15 Rasgulla – homemade or store brought ones</li>
			<li>1 litre whole milk</li>
			<li>4 to 5 tablespoons sugar or add as required</li>
			<li>10 to 12 almonds unsalted – blanched</li>
			<li>10 to 12 pistachios unsalted – blanched</li>
			<li>half cup water for blanching the almonds and pistachios</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon green cardamom powder</li>
			<li>1 to 2 teaspoons rose water or kewra water (pandanus water)</li>
			<li>8 to 10 saffron strands<li>
		 </ul>
		 <h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<h4>Preparation</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>To make rasmalai you will need 12 to 15 rasgulla. Either you can buy them from stores or make them at home.</li>
				<li>Boil ½ cup water. Then add almonds and pistachios. Cover and keep aside for 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
				<li>Later peel the almonds, pistachios and slice them finely. Set aside.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Thickening milk to make rabdi</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>When the almonds are blanching, take milk in a thick bottomed pan or kadai.</li>
				<li>Bring the milk to a boil on medium heat stirring at intervals.</li>
				<li>Whilst the milk is coming to a boil, take 2 tablespoons of milk from the pan in a small bowl.</li>
				<li>Let this milk become warm. Add crushed saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.</li>
				<li>Once the milk has come to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer the milk. Collect the floating clotted cream (malai) on the sides. Continue to cook this way till the milk is reduced to half.</li>
				<li>Keep on collecting the cream which floats on the top and move it to the sides. Also keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the milk does not get scorched at the bottom.</li>
				<li>Add sugar and stir well so that the sugar dissolves.</li>
				<li>Then add cardamom powder.</li>
				<li>Add the blanched and sliced almonds and pistachios. Reserve a few almonds and pistachios for garnishing.</li>
				<li>Also add the saffron infused milk.</li>
				<li>Stir again. Keep simmering the reduced milk at a low heat.</li>
			</ol> 
			<h4>Making rasmalai</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Take each rasgulla and with a spatula and apply pressure, so the excess sugar syrup is removed from it.</li>
				<li>You can also press and squeeze each rasgulla in your palms. Be gentle and don't apply too much of pressure. As then the rasgullas will break. Repeat with all the rasgulla balls.</li>
				<li>Now place the rasgulla in the simmering milk and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes on a low heat.</li>
				<li>Switch off the heat and then add rose water or kewra water (pandanus water)</li>
				<li>Stir gently. Cover and let the rasmalai come to room temperature. Then chill in a covered container or bowl.</li>
				<li>Serve garnished with blanched, sliced almonds or pistachios that were kept aside and a few saffron strands.</li>
				<li>You can also serve rasmalai warm or at room temperature.</li>
